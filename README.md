# landing-page

Hey everyone, welcome back! This is going to be my second official project with the Odin Project and today, I'm going to be making a full landing page design provided by TOP using everything that I have learned up until this point about HTML and CSS. In this project though specifically, I will be focusing on using Flexbox to get elements where I need them on the page and showcasing my awesome CSS skills! With that said, thank you for viewing this repo!

The design of the landing page that I will be replicating is provided by the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/), the best place to learn full-stack web development for absolutely free. Thank you to the community for allowing me a chance to showcase my CSS knowledge through this project!
